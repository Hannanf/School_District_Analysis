School_District_Analysis Module 4 Challange

______________________________________________________________________
Module 3 Challenge —Using Python and the Pandas Library to Filter and Analyze Student Data from Various Grades, Schools, and Districts
______________________________________________________________________

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 
______________________________________________________________________
The objective of the module is to apply the python programming language, in particular the Pandas library to analyze student data. We filtered various .csv files containing student, and school data to collect pertinent information required to perform our analysis. We cleaned data by replacing certain values with NaN values. We then performed a throughout analysis to provide the following information to and compared the results before and after replacing values with NaN

1) Summary of the all the schools in the district,
2)School summary
3)Top 5 performing schools 
4)Bottom 5 performing schools 
5)Average math score for each grade from each school 
6)Average  reading score for each grade from each school
7)cores by school spending per student 
8)Scores based on school size 
9)Scores based on school type

1) How is the district summary affected? 

As seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below, the number of students decreases

Figure 2 —District Summary before replacing THS values

2) How is the school summary affected?
As seen in figure 3 and figure 4 the percentage of students passing reading and math increases 

Figure 3— School Summary before replacing THS 9th grades values to NaN








Figure 4 — School Summary after replacing THS 9th grades values to NaN

3) How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
As seen in Figure 5 and 6, the performance of THS increases when comparing the percentage of overall passing 
Figure 5 — Top performing schools before replacing THS 9th grades values to NaN

Figure 6— Top performing schools before after THS 9th grades values to NaN
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
1) Math and reading scores by grade — 
2) Scores by school spending
3) Scores by school size
4) Scores by school type
